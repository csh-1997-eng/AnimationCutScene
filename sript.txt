**Narrator**: In the grand castle of Eldoria, a knight named Sir Byte, once hailed as a hero, makes his way through the dimly lit corridors towards the throne room. His heart heavy with anticipation, for today he is to face his liege, King Algorithm, and learn the truth behind his unjust exile.

**Scene: Throne Room**

[Heavy wooden doors creak open as Sir Byte enters the opulent throne room. King Algorithm sits upon his throne, adorned in regal attire, a stern gaze fixed upon the knight.]

**Sir Byte**: (with determination) Your Majesty, I stand before you. What is the meaning of these accusations?

**King Algorithm**: (coldly) Sir Byte, once my most trusted knight, I have received grave reports of your treachery. Rumors have reached my ears that you conspired with our enemies, betraying your oath and our kingdom.

**Sir Byte**: (shocked) Your Majesty, I assure you, these accusations are baseless! I have served you faithfully, risking my life countless times in your name.

**King Algorithm**: (dismissively) Words can be deceiving, Sir Byte. The evidence against you is substantial. Witnesses claim to have seen you meeting with known enemies in secret.

**Narrator**: The knight's eyes widen, disbelief and anger coursing through his veins. He realizes that he has become a pawn in a wicked game, orchestrated by the very king he had sworn to protect.

**Sir Byte**: (voice trembling with anger) My liege, I have been betrayed! It is you who have conspired against me, not the other way around. I shall not rest until I uncover the truth and bring justice to the name of Sir Byte!

**Scene: Sir Byte's Determination**
